The App:

Fundamental structure of the app is based off a master TableViewController. All other tableviewcontrollers are subclassed from this. Furthermore I as able to reuse the same detailviewcontroller for all three separate tableviewcontrollers. 

I based this app off of all the previous projects we built.
