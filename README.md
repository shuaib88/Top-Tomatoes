## The App:

Top Tomatoes is a great app for keeping track of movies you’d like to see. With this app, you can check out movies currently in theaters, as well as movies coming out soon. You can even save movies you’d like to see for later!

Fundamental structure of the app is based off a master TableViewController. All other tableviewcontrollers are subclassed from this. I was able to reuse the same detailviewcontroller for all three separate tableviewcontrollers.
